# Deprecated file: copilot-setup-steps222.yml
#
# This file previously contained a GitHub Actions workflow definition for
# "Copilot Setup Steps" at the repository root. GitHub Actions only
# recognizes workflows located under the `.github/workflows/` directory.
#
# According to `.github/workflows/3-prepare-environment.yml` (line 92),
# the Copilot setup workflow must be located at:
#   .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml
#
# To avoid having a mislocated workflow definition, this file has been
# intentionally left as comments only. The actual workflow should be
# defined and maintained in `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`.
